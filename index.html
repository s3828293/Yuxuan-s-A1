  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer1">I first noticed that the only two colors on this page are yellow for the background, and green for the text, and no image!</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer2">Action 1: Click on the title and author's name (they are combined), and the page is expanded with a number of phrases and bar graphs. Action 2: Click on the first phrase and a poem appears, with word after word and with music.Action 3: I clicked on the mute in the upper right corner, and when I clicked on it the music was gone, but that doesn't mean it stopped, it should just be that the sound on this site was turned off.Action 4: In the lower right corner, there is a symbol like a plus or multiplication sign, put the mouse over it and a bunch of reading machines appear.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer3')">3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer3">I experience the second action the most because it has a total of seven phrases to click on, each followed by different content and music.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer4')">4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer4">Click on the different phrases or names of the poems because there are so many of them, seven in all!</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer5')">5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer5">I think the author just wanted to show the seven poems in an engaging and interesting way.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer6')">6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer6">With the novelty of words appearing one after the other, the whole poem appears at the end, and each poem is equipped with a different bgm.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer7')">7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer7">When I first clicked into this site I thought I could interact by clicking on the phrases or columns in there, but it all ended up being the same way.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer8')">8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer8">I think the author also applied only one way of mouse clicking, the web page looks too simple.(but it's not)</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer9')">9)  What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer9">Just audio</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer10')">10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer10">It's a good idea to be able to add different background music based on different options</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer11')">11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer11">Just relax, even if it seems simple it can be fun!</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer12')">12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer12">The music is fun, but there's no way to stop them individually with too many clicks, and muting is the only way to quiet them down.</div>

  <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer13')">13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</div>
  <div class="answer" id="answer13">I like the way his verses are conveyed, keyword by keyword, it keeps me focused.</div>
